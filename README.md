# 📅 University Class Scheduler Maker

A Django-powered backend system designed to automate the creation of closed-credit class schedules for university semesters.  
Built with scalability, flexibility, and real-world deployment in mind, this project streamlines one of the most time-consuming administrative tasks in academic institutions.

---

## 🚀 Overview
Scheduling university classes involves balancing multiple constraints — classroom availability, faculty schedules, credit limits, and avoiding student timetable conflicts.  
This backend service provides a **robust scheduling engine** that processes all these variables and generates **optimized, conflict-free schedules** in just seconds.

While originally built for my university, the core design allows for **easy customization** for different institutions and academic structures.
